This indicates that supply chain attacks have become a normalized threat, requiring the ecosystem to continuously raise vigilance and defense capabilities. |\r\n\r\nI complained a bit on Twitter, and while complaining, I saw a tweet from a friend who had just encountered a supply chain attack incident.\r\n\r\n[![Twitter](https://static.miantiao.me/share/ZUy0MY/twitter.jpeg)](https://x.com/tcdwww/status/1914202659210359108)\r\n\r\nFortunately, [@TBXark](https://x.com/TBXark) recommended his **MCP Proxy** project, which makes it very convenient to run MCP Server in Docker. His initial goal was to run MCP Server on a server to reduce client load and facilitate mobile client calls. However, Docker's inherent isolation features perfectly aligned with my requirement for a sandbox.\r\n\r\nMCP Proxy runs MCP Servers in Docker and converts the protocol to MCP SSE, allowing users to make all calls via the SSE protocol from the MCP client. This can significantly reduce the risk of arbitrary file reading caused by directly running npx and uvx. *If deployed on an overseas server, it can also help solve network issues.*\r\n\r\nHowever, it is currently still possible to read the `/config/config.json` configuration file of MCP Proxy, but the risk is manageable. I have also raised a feature request with the developer to configure the config file with 400 permissions and run the npx and uvx commands as the nobody user. If this can be implemented, it will perfectly solve the arbitrary file reading issue.\r\n\r\n## Running MCP Proxy\r\n\r\n[![MCP Proxy](https://github.html.zone/TBXark/mcp-proxy)](https://github.com/TBXark/mcp-proxy)\r\n\r\nIf you have your own VPS with Docker deployed, you can use the following command to run MCP Proxy.\r\n\r\n```\r\ndocker run -d -p 9090:9090 -v /path/to/config.json:/config/config.json ghcr.io/tbxark/mcp-proxy:latest\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you don't have your own VPS, you can use the free container service provided by [**claw.cloud**](https://404.li/claw) ($5 credit per month, GitHub registration must be older than 180 days).\r\n\r\nSince Claw has container size limitations, we need to use the following environment variables to configure the cache directories for npx and uvx to prevent container crashes.\r\n\r\n```\r\nUV_CACHE_DIR=/cache/uv\r\nnpm_config_cache=/cache/npm\r\n```\r\n\r\nSimultaneously mount 10GB of storage under the `/cache` path.

核心方法：破解产品经理4大痛点\r\n\r\n### 痛点1：需求收集抓不住重点——用“卡点梳理+目标拆解”找关键问题\r\n\r\n需求调研时，常因信息繁杂导致无法定位核心问题。可通过两个工具精准破局：\r\n\r\n1. **卡点梳理：像“连连看”一样串联问题与方案**  \r\n   明确“角色-场景-目标-问题-方案”的对应关系，将模糊需求转化为具体行动项。以本项目为例：\r\n\r\n   | 核心问题 | 解决方案 |\r\n   |----------|----------|\r\n   | 提货任务滞后，无法提前派车 | 搭建「日历」功能，可视化展示到货情况 |\r\n   | 线下预约卡车效率低 | 搭建「任务」模块，支持在线约车并自动发邮件 |\r\n   | 财务手工对账，成本计算慢 | 搭建「成本账单」功能，满足自动化费用核算 |\r\n\r\n2. **目标拆解：用“业务环节→目标→数据指标”明确价值**  \r\n   先拆解业务流程，再推导项目目标，最后落地为可量化的指标，确保方案有明确的价值导向。以“卡车调度”为例：\r\n   - 业务环节：统计包裹信息→预估卡车资源→预约卡车→跟进提货→通知仓库；\r\n   - 项目目标：提升货量统计效率、减少卡车预估时间、降低提货成本、提升入库效率；\r\n   - 数据指标：卡车预约平均时间（从5h降至3h）、单批包裹提货费用（从300USD降至290USD）。\r\n\r\n### 痛点2：跨部门协作不同步——用“共享文档”统一信息源\r\n\r\n跨部门沟通时，易因信息不对称导致分歧或进度滞后。产品经理可主动承担“信息整合者”角色，通过共享文档解决问题：\r\n\r\n- **文档核心内容**：包含业务流程、方案卡点对齐、会议纪要、调研附录等，确保所有成员基于同一信息沟通；\r\n- **文档价值**：  \r\n  1. 实时补充项目进展，减少重复沟通；  \r\n  2. 分歧时可追溯历史记录，快速调整；  \r\n  3. 业务方反馈需求未满足时，可作为沟通依据，避免“背锅”。  \r\n- **灵活适配**：除共享文档外，国际化团队可使用邮件作为讨论锚点，贴合团队沟通习惯。\r\n\r\n### 痛点3：汇报/沟通低效——用“流程图+表格”简化信息传递\r\n\r\n用大段文字汇报或沟通时，易让听众陷入细节、忽略全局。建议用可视化工具提升效率：\r\n\r\n1. **流程图：快速对齐项目全貌**  \r\n   用流程图展示核心角色与业务流程，让所有成员一眼看懂项目逻辑。例如清关转运项目的角色流程表：\r\n\r\n   | 角色       | 核心流程                 |\r\n   |------------|--------------------------|\r\n   | 清关经理   | 完成清关→同步提货任务信息 |\r\n   | 仓库调度员 | 接收信息→预约卡车        |\r\n   | 卡车供应商 | 响应预约→完成提货        |\r\n   | 库内操作人员 | 接收包裹→揽货整理        |\r\n   | 财务人员   | 基于数据→成本核算        |\r\n\r\n2. **场景表格：明确细节规则**  \r\n   针对复杂业务规则（如多方确认的需求），用表格记录“角色-场景-规则-功能-模块”，避免遗漏。示例：\r\n\r\n   | 角色     | 场景及动机                                                                 | 规则                 | 功能       | 模块       |\r\n   |----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|------------|------------|\r\n   | 清关经理 | 1. 分配任务，选择对应参数完成配置；2. 地勤提货后，通知仓库理货               | 1. 任务需符合货型要求；2. 预约需关联清关公司 | 分配任务   | 清关       |\r\n   | 调度员   | 1. 提前规划提货，查看今日/明日到货信息                                     | 1. 到港时间需精准至小时；2. 理货时间需预留缓冲 | 日历查看、卡车预约 | 提货转运   |\r\n\r\n### 痛点4：用户看不懂产品——用“福格行为模型”优化设计\r\n\r\n产品上线后，用户常困惑“功能是干嘛的”，核心原因是未考虑用户“动机-能力-提示”的匹配。可运用《福格行为模型》优化设计：\r\n\r\n- **模型核心**：用户产生行为=有动机（想做）+有能力（能做）+有提示（知道怎么做）；\r\n- **落地案例：卡车预约页面设计**  \r\n  1. **动机**：调度员需完成卡车预约以保障提货；  \r\n  2. **能力**：简化操作（如下拉选择车型、车次号）；  \r\n  3. **提示**：关键节点增加引导文案，例如：  \r\n     - “若未创建XX，请先在XX模块操作”；  \r\n     - “提交后，任务状态将更新为XX，卡车状态同步变更”。  \r\n\r\n该方法不仅适用于C端产品，在B端（如物流调度系统）中同样能大幅提升用户使用流畅度。\r\n\r\n## 总结：产品经理的“高效心法”\r\n\r\n1. **基本功优先**：卡点梳理、目标拆解是明确需求的核心，需扎实掌握；  \r\n2. **主动承担角色**：跨部门项目中，主动整合信息、推动对齐，既能提升团队效率，也能增强个人影响力；  \r\n3. **工具为目标服务**：流程图、表格、共享文档等工具，本质是简化沟通、降低协作成本，无需追求形式，贴合需求即可；  \r\n4. **用户视角设计**：无论C端还是B端，始终考虑用户“是否懂、是否会用”，行为模型是重要辅助工具。","src/content/post/产品经理/产品经理痛点破解.md","15ffd6addf83eef3",{"html":259,"metadata":260},"\u003Ch2

一、前置认知：AI能力封装的核心目标\r\n企业内部AI落地的核心原则是“All in one”，即整合**AI能力、业务经验、业务流程、应用场景**四大要素。其中，“封装并分发到各业务系统”是关键路径之一——通过API、浏览器插件等形式，将AI能力嵌入用户已习惯的业务系统中，降低使用门槛，避免用户因切换新系统而放弃AI功能。\r\n\r\n本质上，AI能力封装需解决两个核心问题：  \r\n1. **体验无缝化**：让AI功能自然融入业务流程，而非独立存在；  \r\n2. **价值显性化**：确保AI能力直接作用于业务痛点（如提效、降本、控风险），而非“炫技式功能”。\r\n\r\n\r\n## 二、三类核心方案：AI能力封装的路径选择\r\n不同业务系统的流程特性、用户习惯差异较大，需针对性选择封装方案。以下从“流程融合”“聚合助手”“入口导流”三类方案展开分析：\r\n\r\n### 方案一：基于业务流程的融合——让AI成为流程的“自然步骤”\r\n#### 核心逻辑\r\n将AI能力无缝编织进用户熟悉的核心业务流程中，AI不再是独立模块，而是作为“智能化步骤”或“增强环节”存在（如客服工单系统中，用户输入问题时实时推荐解决方案）。\r\n\r\n#### 优缺点对比\r\n| 优点 | 缺点 |\r\n|------|------|\r\n| 1. 用户体验流畅，学习成本极低（无需适应新操作）\u003Cbr>2. AI价值直接作用于核心业务，提效/控险效果显著\u003Cbr>3. 用户采纳率高（贴合既有使用习惯） | 1. 需深度理解现有流程，集成开发工作量大（需跨技术团队协作）\u003Cbr>2. 对AI输出的稳定性、即时性要求高（否则可能阻塞流程）\u003Cbr>3. 无法强化“AI中台”认知（用户会归因于业务系统本身） |\r\n\r\n#### 关键落地步骤\r\n1. **盘点AI切入点：从业务痛点出发**  \r\n   先拆解业务流程（如“寻找灵感→制作草稿→收集素材→成稿→上线”），再通过**业务调研、访谈、轮岗**挖掘痛点（重复、低效、易错等），最后评估AI技术的可行性。可参考下表梳理：\r\n\r\n   | 核心流程 | 切入点       | 相关AI技术               | 实现难度 | 原因分析                     |\r\n   |----------|--------------|--------------------------|----------|------------------------------|\r\n   | 寻找灵感 | 行业情报收集 | 信息采集（爬虫+AI精准度提升） | 简单     | 核心为爬虫技术，AI仅辅助提效 |\r\n   | 寻找灵感 | 灵感提取     | 图片/视频内容提取与分析   | 中等     | 提取易，分析行业所需信息难   |\r\n   | 制作草稿 | 图片素材草图 | AI生图                   | 简单     | 市面技术成熟，落地成本低     |\r\n\r\n2. **选择AI嵌入模式：按“业务连续性+AI响应速度”分类**  \r\n   不同业务对“流程中断容忍度”和“AI响应时效”要求不同，需匹配对应的嵌入模式：\r\n\r\n   | AI响应速度 | 高连续性业务（中断致损失，如风险审核） | 低连续性业务（可暂停，如素材制作） |\r\n   |------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\r\n   | 响应快     | 实时无缝切入（如验证码实时风险检测）   | 即时辅助工具（如客服话术推荐）     |\r\n   | 响应慢     | 主流程阻塞（如高风险业务AI审核）       | 异步后台处理（如分镜画面生成）     |\r\n\r\n   各模式关键注意点：  \r\n   - **实时无缝切入**：需预备AI超时应急方案（如跳过检测，避免阻塞流程）；  \r\n   - **即时辅助工具**：AI结果为“可选项”，用悬浮气泡/独立区域承载，不干扰主流程；  \r\n   - **主流程阻塞**：显示等待进度（如“预计3分钟”），支持任务中断后恢复；  \r\n   - **异步后台处理**：提供任务队列+进度通知，生成结果自动填充主流程（避免用户手动粘贴）。\r\n\r\n3. **设计兜底逻辑：应对AI错误风险**  \r\n   针对“AI错误可能导致严重损失”的场景，需补充容错机制：  \r\n   - **分级人工审核**：AI生成结果先经机审初筛，高风险内容再转人工；  \r\n   - **可修正性设计**：文本/表格支持实时编辑，图片/视频支持局部重生成。\r\n\r\n4. **强化中台品牌：避免价值归因偏差**  \r\n   通过技术标识（如“Powered by AI中台”水印）、效能仪表盘（定期推送调用量/人力节省数据）、案例宣导，让业务方感知AI中台价值。\r\n\r\n\r\n### 方案二：提供聚合的服务助手——打造“AI能力一站式入口”\r\n#### 核心逻辑\r\n将分散的AI能力（如智能搜索、文档摘要、图像识别）聚合成统一的“智能助手”（如知识管理平台的AI悬浮球），作为系统内独立功能区域，用户按需取用。\r\n\r\n#### 优缺点对比\r\n| 优点 | 缺点 |\r\n|------|------|\r\n| 1. 功能集中，用户易发现多种AI能力\u003Cbr>2. 降低重复集成成本（一次集成，多处可用）\u003Cbr>3. 便于统一管理、更新AI能力\u003Cbr>4. 用户主动选择权高 | 1. 业务流程割裂（需在主系统与助手间切换）\u003Cbr>2. 用户易“想不起来用”或“不知用哪个” |\r\n\r\n#### 关键落地步骤\r\n1. **AI能力聚合：满足“解耦+闭环”需求**  \r\n   - 功能解耦：每个AI能力为独立模块，即开即用；  \r\n   - 通用能力标准化：如图片类功能统一“任务列表”模块管理进度；  \r\n   - 流程闭环：从需求触发（如“生成文档摘要”）到结果反馈（如推送摘要至主系统）全链路覆盖；  \r\n   - 权限统一：集成身份校验，确保用户仅访问授权能力。\r\n\r\n2. **提供快速检索：解决“能力太多找不到”问题**  \r\n   当AI能力量级较大时，需通过多维度机制帮助用户定位需求：  \r\n   - **多维度检索**：支持关键词、业务场景、历史记录筛选；  \r\n   - **系统推荐**：基于使用量、效果数据推荐高频能力（如新用户引导）；  \r\n   - **自然语言搜索**：构建RAG工程，用户用对话描述需求（如“帮我总结这份会议纪要”），助手自动匹配能力；  \r\n   - **标签分类体系**：按业务领域（如“客服”“财务”）、操作类型（如“生成”“分析”）打标签，便于筛选。\r\n\r\n\r\n### 方案三：提供入口导流——最简单的“轻量化整合”\r\n#### 核心逻辑\r\n在现有业务系统界面（导航栏、工具栏）放置指向独立AI应用的入口（如按钮/链接），用户点击跳转至专门AI界面。\r\n\r\n#### 优缺点对比\r\n| 优点 | 缺点 |\r\n|------|------|\r\n| 1. 实现简单，开发/维护成本低\u003Cbr>2. 对原有系统侵入性最小 | 1. 用户体验割裂（跳转致使用中断）\u003Cbr>2. 难深度结合业务数据（需额外打通数据）\u003Cbr>3. 风格/体验易不一致（独立AI应用与主系统） |\r\n\r\n#### 适用场景\r\n仅推荐在**人力成本极有限、AI需求非核心**的场景临时使用，不建议作为长期方案。\r\n\r\n\r\n## 三、总结：方案选择的核心原则\r\n1. **优先匹配业务属性**：核心流程用“方案一（流程融合）”，多场景零散需求用“方案二（聚合助手）”，临时轻量化需求用“方案三（入口导流）”；  \r\n2. **用户体验为核心**：避免为“封装AI”而破坏既有使用习惯，需平衡“AI价值”与“操作成本”；  \r\n3. **分阶段落地**：先从“高痛点、易落地”场景切入（如客服话术推荐），再逐步拓展至复杂场景（如全流程AI审核）；  \r\n4. **不局限单一方案**：可组合使用（如主流程用方案一，辅助需求用方案二），灵活适配业务变化。\r\n\r\nAI能力封装的本质不是“技术堆砌”，而是“以业务价值为导向，让AI成为用户解决问题的自然工具”。只有贴合业务流程、降低使用门槛，才能真正实现AI与业务的高效协同。","src/content/post/产品经理/AI能力封装到业务系统.md","b42642039000a2c2",{"html":301,"metadata":302},"\u003Cp>在企业数字化进程中，如何将AI能力与现有业务系统高效融合，避免“AI孤岛”并最大化其价值，是许多产品与技术团队面临的核心问题。本文基于“企业内部B端产品落地AI”的实践经验，聚焦“AI能力封装到已有业务系统”的三类方案，从设计逻辑、优缺点到落地细节展开拆解，为实操提供参考。\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"一前置认知ai能力封装的核心目标\">一、前置认知：AI能力封装的核心目标\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>企业内部AI落地的核心原则是“All in one”，即整合\u003Cstrong>AI能力、业务经验、业务流程、应用场景\u003C/strong>四大要素。其中，“封装并分发到各业务系统”是关键路径之一——通过API、浏览器插件等形式，将AI能力嵌入用户已习惯的业务系统中，降低使用门槛，避免用户因切换新系统而放弃AI功能。\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>本质上，AI能力封装需解决两个核心问题：\u003C/p>\n\u003Col>\n\u003Cli>\u003Cstrong>体验无缝化\u003C/strong>：让AI功能自然融入业务流程，而非独立存在；\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Cstrong>价值显性化\u003C/strong>：确保AI能力直接作用于业务痛点（如提效、降本、控风险），而非“炫技式功能”。\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ol>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"二三类核心方案ai能力封装的路径选择\">二、三类核心方案：AI能力封装的路径选择\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>不同业务系统的流程特性、用户习惯差异较大，需针对性选择封装方案。以下从“流程融合”“聚合助手”“入口导流”三类方案展开分析：\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"方案一基于业务流程的融合让ai成为流程的自然步骤\">方案一：基于业务流程的融合——让AI成为流程的“自然步骤”\u003C/h3>\n\u003Ch4 id=\"核心逻辑\">核心逻辑\u003C/h4>\n\u003Cp>将AI能力无缝编织进用户熟悉的核心业务流程中，AI不再是独立模块，而是作为“智能化步骤”或“增强环节”存在（如客服工单系统中，用户输入问题时实时推荐解决方案）。\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch4 id=\"优缺点对比\">优缺点对比\u003C/h4>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003Ctable>\u003Cthead>\u003Ctr>\u003Cth>优点\u003C/th>\u003Cth>缺点\u003C/th>\u003C/tr>\u003C/thead>\u003Ctbody>\u003Ctr>\u003Ctd>1. 用户体验流畅，学习成本极低（无需适应新操作）\u003Cbr>2.
