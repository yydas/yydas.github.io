This demonstration sparked high concern within the industry regarding supply chain risks. |\n| **October 2021** | **UAParser.js Library Hijacked** | The popular library _ua-parser-js_ on NPM, with over 7 million weekly downloads, was compromised by attackers via the maintainer's account to publish malicious versions ([A Timeline of SSC Attacks, Curated by Sonatype](https://www.sonatype.com/resources/vulnerability-timeline#:~:text=%23%23%20%20Popular%20%22ua,Attacked)). Infected versions implanted **password-stealing trojans** and **cryptocurrency miners** upon installation, affecting a large number of developer systems. |\n| **October 2021** | **Poisoning via Fake Roblox Libraries** | Attackers uploaded multiple packages impersonating Roblox API on NPM (e.g., _noblox.js-proxy_), containing obfuscated malicious code. These packages would implant **trojans and ransomware** payloads after installation ([A Timeline of SSC Attacks, Curated by Sonatype](https://www.sonatype.com/resources/vulnerability-timeline#:~:text=,and%20has%20a%20Spooky%20Surprise)). These packages were downloaded thousands of times, demonstrating attackers used **typosquatting** to trick game developers. |\n| **November 2021** | **COA and RC Libraries Successively Hijacked** | Popular libraries on NPM, _coa_ (millions of weekly downloads) and _rc_ (14 million weekly downloads), were successively compromised to publish malicious versions. The affected versions executed **credential-stealing trojans** similar to the UAParser.js case, at one point causing build pipelines to break for numerous projects globally using frameworks like React ([A Timeline of SSC Attacks, Curated by Sonatype](https://www.sonatype.com/resources/vulnerability-timeline#:~:text=,js)) ([A Timeline of SSC Attacks, Curated by Sonatype](https://www.sonatype.com/resources/vulnerability-timeline#:~:text=,Is%20Hijacked%2C%20Too)). Official investigations determined the cause in both cases was compromised maintainer accounts. |\n| **January 2022** | **Colors/Faker Open Source Libraries \"Suicide\"** | The authors of the famous color formatting library _colors.js_ and test data generation library _faker.js_, out of protest, injected destructive code like infinite loops in the latest versions, causing thousands of projects, including those at companies like Meta (Facebook) and Amazon, to crash ([A Timeline of SSC Attacks, Curated by Sonatype](https://www.sonatype.com/resources/vulnerability-timeline#:~:text=Thousands%20of%20open%20source%20projects,companies%20exploiting%20open%20source)) (While not an external attack, it falls within the scope of supply chain poisoning). |\n| **January 2022** | **PyPI: 1,275 Malicious Packages Deployed in Bulk** | A single user frantically published **1,275 malicious packages** to PyPI in one day on January 23rd ([A Timeline of SSC Attacks, Curated by Sonatype](https://www.sonatype.com/resources/vulnerability-timeline#:~:text=,Than%201%2C200%20Dependency%20Confusion%20Packages)). Most of these packages impersonated the names of well-known projects or companies (e.g., _xcryptography_, _Sagepay_, etc.).

This indicates that supply chain attacks have become a normalized threat, requiring the ecosystem to continuously raise vigilance and defense capabilities. |\n\nI complained a bit on Twitter, and while complaining, I saw a tweet from a friend who had just encountered a supply chain attack incident.\n\n[![Twitter](https://static.miantiao.me/share/ZUy0MY/twitter.jpeg)](https://x.com/tcdwww/status/1914202659210359108)\n\nFortunately, [@TBXark](https://x.com/TBXark) recommended his **MCP Proxy** project, which makes it very convenient to run MCP Server in Docker. His initial goal was to run MCP Server on a server to reduce client load and facilitate mobile client calls. However, Docker's inherent isolation features perfectly aligned with my requirement for a sandbox.\n\nMCP Proxy runs MCP Servers in Docker and converts the protocol to MCP SSE, allowing users to make all calls via the SSE protocol from the MCP client. This can significantly reduce the risk of arbitrary file reading caused by directly running npx and uvx. *If deployed on an overseas server, it can also help solve network issues.*\n\nHowever, it is currently still possible to read the `/config/config.json` configuration file of MCP Proxy, but the risk is manageable. I have also raised a feature request with the developer to configure the config file with 400 permissions and run the npx and uvx commands as the nobody user. If this can be implemented, it will perfectly solve the arbitrary file reading issue.\n\n## Running MCP Proxy\n\n[![MCP Proxy](https://github.html.zone/TBXark/mcp-proxy)](https://github.com/TBXark/mcp-proxy)\n\nIf you have your own VPS with Docker deployed, you can use the following command to run MCP Proxy.\n\n```\ndocker run -d -p 9090:9090 -v /path/to/config.json:/config/config.json ghcr.io/tbxark/mcp-proxy:latest\n```\n\nIf you don't have your own VPS, you can use the free container service provided by [**claw.cloud**](https://404.li/claw) ($5 credit per month, GitHub registration must be older than 180 days).\n\nSince Claw has container size limitations, we need to use the following environment variables to configure the cache directories for npx and uvx to prevent container crashes.\n\n```\nUV_CACHE_DIR=/cache/uv\nnpm_config_cache=/cache/npm\n```\n\nSimultaneously mount 10GB of storage under the `/cache` path. Refer to my configuration: 0.5c CPU, 512M Memory, 10G Disk.\n\nThe final configuration is as follows:\n\n![Claw](https://static.miantiao.me/share/g4KUgP/claw.jpg)\n\n## Configuring MCP Proxy\n\nThe configuration file needs to be mounted at the `/config/config.json` path.

核心方法：破解产品经理4大痛点\n\n### 痛点1：需求收集抓不住重点——用“卡点梳理+目标拆解”找关键问题\n\n需求调研时，常因信息繁杂导致无法定位核心问题。可通过两个工具精准破局：\n\n1. **卡点梳理：像“连连看”一样串联问题与方案**  \n   明确“角色-场景-目标-问题-方案”的对应关系，将模糊需求转化为具体行动项。以本项目为例：\n\n   | 核心问题 | 解决方案 |\n   |----------|----------|\n   | 提货任务滞后，无法提前派车 | 搭建「日历」功能，可视化展示到货情况 |\n   | 线下预约卡车效率低 | 搭建「任务」模块，支持在线约车并自动发邮件 |\n   | 财务手工对账，成本计算慢 | 搭建「成本账单」功能，满足自动化费用核算 |\n\n2. **目标拆解：用“业务环节→目标→数据指标”明确价值**  \n   先拆解业务流程，再推导项目目标，最后落地为可量化的指标，确保方案有明确的价值导向。以“卡车调度”为例：\n   - 业务环节：统计包裹信息→预估卡车资源→预约卡车→跟进提货→通知仓库；\n   - 项目目标：提升货量统计效率、减少卡车预估时间、降低提货成本、提升入库效率；\n   - 数据指标：卡车预约平均时间（从5h降至3h）、单批包裹提货费用（从300USD降至290USD）。\n\n### 痛点2：跨部门协作不同步——用“共享文档”统一信息源\n\n跨部门沟通时，易因信息不对称导致分歧或进度滞后。产品经理可主动承担“信息整合者”角色，通过共享文档解决问题：\n\n- **文档核心内容**：包含业务流程、方案卡点对齐、会议纪要、调研附录等，确保所有成员基于同一信息沟通；\n- **文档价值**：  \n  1. 实时补充项目进展，减少重复沟通；  \n  2. 分歧时可追溯历史记录，快速调整；  \n  3. 业务方反馈需求未满足时，可作为沟通依据，避免“背锅”。  \n- **灵活适配**：除共享文档外，国际化团队可使用邮件作为讨论锚点，贴合团队沟通习惯。\n\n### 痛点3：汇报/沟通低效——用“流程图+表格”简化信息传递\n\n用大段文字汇报或沟通时，易让听众陷入细节、忽略全局。建议用可视化工具提升效率：\n\n1. **流程图：快速对齐项目全貌**  \n   用流程图展示核心角色与业务流程，让所有成员一眼看懂项目逻辑。例如清关转运项目的角色流程表：\n\n   | 角色       | 核心流程                 |\n   |------------|--------------------------|\n   | 清关经理   | 完成清关→同步提货任务信息 |\n   | 仓库调度员 | 接收信息→预约卡车        |\n   | 卡车供应商 | 响应预约→完成提货        |\n   | 库内操作人员 | 接收包裹→揽货整理        |\n   | 财务人员   | 基于数据→成本核算        |\n\n2. **场景表格：明确细节规则**  \n   针对复杂业务规则（如多方确认的需求），用表格记录“角色-场景-规则-功能-模块”，避免遗漏。示例：\n\n   | 角色     | 场景及动机                                                                 | 规则                 | 功能       | 模块       |\n   |----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|------------|------------|\n   | 清关经理 | 1. 分配任务，选择对应参数完成配置；2. 地勤提货后，通知仓库理货               | 1. 任务需符合货型要求；2. 预约需关联清关公司 | 分配任务   | 清关       |\n   | 调度员   | 1. 提前规划提货，查看今日/明日到货信息                                     | 1. 到港时间需精准至小时；2. 理货时间需预留缓冲 | 日历查看、卡车预约 | 提货转运   |\n\n### 痛点4：用户看不懂产品——用“福格行为模型”优化设计\n\n产品上线后，用户常困惑“功能是干嘛的”，核心原因是未考虑用户“动机-能力-提示”的匹配。可运用《福格行为模型》优化设计：\n\n- **模型核心**：用户产生行为=有动机（想做）+有能力（能做）+有提示（知道怎么做）；\n- **落地案例：卡车预约页面设计**  \n  1. **动机**：调度员需完成卡车预约以保障提货；  \n  2. **能力**：简化操作（如下拉选择车型、车次号）；  \n  3. **提示**：关键节点增加引导文案，例如：  \n     - “若未创建XX，请先在XX模块操作”；  \n     - “提交后，任务状态将更新为XX，卡车状态同步变更”。  \n\n该方法不仅适用于C端产品，在B端（如物流调度系统）中同样能大幅提升用户使用流畅度。\n\n## 总结：产品经理的“高效心法”\n\n1. **基本功优先**：卡点梳理、目标拆解是明确需求的核心，需扎实掌握；  \n2. **主动承担角色**：跨部门项目中，主动整合信息、推动对齐，既能提升团队效率，也能增强个人影响力；  \n3. **工具为目标服务**：流程图、表格、共享文档等工具，本质是简化沟通、降低协作成本，无需追求形式，贴合需求即可；  \n4. **用户视角设计**：无论C端还是B端，始终考虑用户“是否懂、是否会用”，行为模型是重要辅助工具。","src/content/post/产品经理/产品经理痛点破解.md","0fa2b3640c96fbec",{"html":252,"metadata":253},"\u003Ch2

基本使用\n\n### 在 Astro 组件中使用\n\n```astro\n---\nimport SplineViewer from \"../SplineViewer.jsx\";\n---\n\n\u003Cdiv class=\"w-full h-96\">\n  \u003CSplineViewer \n    client:load\n    scene=\"https://prod.spline.design/YOUR_SCENE_ID/scene.splinecode\"\n    className=\"w-full h-full rounded-lg\"\n  />\n\u003C/div>\n```\n\n### 组件属性\n\n| 属性 | 类型 | 必需 | 描述 |\n|------|------|------|------|\n| `scene` | string | 是 | Spline 场景的 URL |\n| `className` | string | 否 | 自定义 CSS 类名 |\n| `onLoad` | function | 否 | 场景加载完成的回调函数 |\n| `...props` | object | 否 | 其他传递给 Spline 组件的属性其他传递给 Spline 组件的属性 |\n\n## 高级用法\n\n### 事件处理\n\n```astro\n\u003CSplineViewer \n  client:load\n  scene=\"https://prod.spline.design/YOUR_SCENE_ID/scene.splinecode\"\n  onLoad={(spline) => {\n    console.log('Spline scene loaded:', spline);\n    // 可以在这里设置场景交互\n  }}\n  onMouseDown={(e) => {\n    console.log('Mouse down on 3D object:', e.target.name);\n  }}\n/>\n```\n\n### 响应式设计\n\n```astro\n\u003Cdiv class=\"w-full h-64 md:h-96 lg:h-[500px]\">\n  \u003CSplineViewer \n    client:load\n    scene=\"https://prod.spline.design/YOUR_SCENE_ID/scene.splinecode\"\n    className=\"w-full h-full rounded-lg shadow-lg\"\n  />\n\u003C/div>\n```\n\n## 获取 Spline 场景 URL\n\n1. 在 [Spline](https://spline.design/) 中创建或编辑你的 3D 场景\n2. 点击右上角的 \"Export\" 按钮\n3. 选择 \"Code\" 选项\n4. 选择 \"React\" 框架\n5. 复制提供的场景 URL\n\n## 性能优化建议\n\n1. **懒加载**: 使用 `client:visible` 或 `client:idle` 指令来延迟加载组件\n2. **预加载**: 对于重要的 3D 场景，可以使用 `client:load` 立即加载\n3. **尺寸控制**: 合理设置容器尺寸，避免过大的 3D 场景影响性能\n\n## 故障排除\n\n### 常见问题\n\n1. **场景不显示**\n   - 检查场景 URL 是否正确\n   - 确保网络连接正常\n   - 检查浏览器控制台是否有错误信息\n\n2. **加载缓慢**\n   - 3D 场景文件可能较大，考虑优化场景复杂度\n   - 使用加载指示器提升用户体验\n\n3. **移动端兼容性**\n   - 某些复杂的 3D 场景在移动设备上可能性能不佳\n   - 考虑为移动端提供简化版本或静态图片替代\n\n## 示例场景\n\n以下是一些可以用于测试的公开 Spline 场景：\n\n- 简单几何体: `https://prod.spline.design/6Wq1Q7YGyM-iab9i/scene.splinecode`\n- 交互式模型: `https://prod.spline.design/YOUR_SCENE_ID/scene.splinecode`\n\n## 更多资源\n\n- [Spline 官方文档](https://docs.spline.design/)\n- [@splinetool/react-spline 文档](https://github.com/splinetool/react-spline)\n-
