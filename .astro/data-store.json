These packages attempted to target users in specific industries (e.g., finance) to implant remote access trojans. It is claimed this attack is linked to previous similar activities targeting NuGet, showing state-sponsored hackers' interest in the open-source supply chain. |\r\n| **2024 and Beyond** | **Ongoing Supply Chain Threats** | Since 2024, new poisoning incidents continue to emerge on NPM and PyPI.

This indicates that supply chain attacks have become a normalized threat, requiring the ecosystem to continuously raise vigilance and defense capabilities. |\r\n\r\nI complained a bit on Twitter, and while complaining, I saw a tweet from a friend who had just encountered a supply chain attack incident.\r\n\r\n[![Twitter](https://static.miantiao.me/share/ZUy0MY/twitter.jpeg)](https://x.com/tcdwww/status/1914202659210359108)\r\n\r\nFortunately, [@TBXark](https://x.com/TBXark) recommended his **MCP Proxy** project, which makes it very convenient to run MCP Server in Docker. His initial goal was to run MCP Server on a server to reduce client load and facilitate mobile client calls. However, Docker's inherent isolation features perfectly aligned with my requirement for a sandbox.\r\n\r\nMCP Proxy runs MCP Servers in Docker and converts the protocol to MCP SSE, allowing users to make all calls via the SSE protocol from the MCP client. This can significantly reduce the risk of arbitrary file reading caused by directly running npx and uvx. *If deployed on an overseas server, it can also help solve network issues.*\r\n\r\nHowever, it is currently still possible to read the `/config/config.json` configuration file of MCP Proxy, but the risk is manageable. I have also raised a feature request with the developer to configure the config file with 400 permissions and run the npx and uvx commands as the nobody user. If this can be implemented, it will perfectly solve the arbitrary file reading issue.\r\n\r\n## Running MCP Proxy\r\n\r\n[![MCP Proxy](https://github.html.zone/TBXark/mcp-proxy)](https://github.com/TBXark/mcp-proxy)\r\n\r\nIf you have your own VPS with Docker deployed, you can use the following command to run MCP Proxy.\r\n\r\n```\r\ndocker run -d -p 9090:9090 -v /path/to/config.json:/config/config.json ghcr.io/tbxark/mcp-proxy:latest\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you don't have your own VPS, you can use the free container service provided by [**claw.cloud**](https://404.li/claw) ($5 credit per month, GitHub registration must be older than 180 days).\r\n\r\nSince Claw has container size limitations, we need to use the following environment variables to configure the cache directories for npx and uvx to prevent container crashes.\r\n\r\n```\r\nUV_CACHE_DIR=/cache/uv\r\nnpm_config_cache=/cache/npm\r\n```\r\n\r\nSimultaneously mount 10GB of storage under the `/cache` path.
