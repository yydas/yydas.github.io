This demonstration sparked high concern within the industry regarding supply chain risks. |\n| **October 2021** | **UAParser.js Library Hijacked** | The popular library _ua-parser-js_ on NPM, with over 7 million weekly downloads, was compromised by attackers via the maintainer's account to publish malicious versions ([A Timeline of SSC Attacks, Curated by Sonatype](https://www.sonatype.com/resources/vulnerability-timeline#:~:text=%23%23%20%20Popular%20%22ua,Attacked)).

These packages would implant **trojans and ransomware** payloads after installation ([A Timeline of SSC Attacks, Curated by Sonatype](https://www.sonatype.com/resources/vulnerability-timeline#:~:text=,and%20has%20a%20Spooky%20Surprise)). These packages were downloaded thousands of times, demonstrating attackers used **typosquatting** to trick game developers. |\n| **November 2021** | **COA and RC Libraries Successively Hijacked** | Popular libraries on NPM, _coa_ (millions of weekly downloads) and _rc_ (14 million weekly downloads), were successively compromised to publish malicious versions. The affected versions executed **credential-stealing trojans** similar to the UAParser.js case, at one point causing build pipelines to break for numerous projects globally using frameworks like React ([A Timeline of SSC Attacks, Curated by Sonatype](https://www.sonatype.com/resources/vulnerability-timeline#:~:text=,js)) ([A Timeline of SSC Attacks, Curated by Sonatype](https://www.sonatype.com/resources/vulnerability-timeline#:~:text=,Is%20Hijacked%2C%20Too)).

These packages attempted to target users in specific industries (e.g., finance) to implant remote access trojans. It is claimed this attack is linked to previous similar activities targeting NuGet, showing state-sponsored hackers' interest in the open-source supply chain. |\n| **2024 and Beyond** | **Ongoing Supply Chain Threats** | Since 2024, new poisoning incidents continue to emerge on NPM and PyPI.

This indicates that supply chain attacks have become a normalized threat, requiring the ecosystem to continuously raise vigilance and defense capabilities. |\n\nI complained a bit on Twitter, and while complaining, I saw a tweet from a friend who had just encountered a supply chain attack incident.\n\n[![Twitter](https://static.miantiao.me/share/ZUy0MY/twitter.jpeg)](https://x.com/tcdwww/status/1914202659210359108)\n\nFortunately, [@TBXark](https://x.com/TBXark) recommended his **MCP Proxy** project, which makes it very convenient to run MCP Server in Docker. His initial goal was to run MCP Server on a server to reduce client load and facilitate mobile client calls. However, Docker's inherent isolation features perfectly aligned with my requirement for a sandbox.\n\nMCP Proxy runs MCP Servers in Docker and converts the protocol to MCP SSE, allowing users to make all calls via the SSE protocol from the MCP client. This can significantly reduce the risk of arbitrary file reading caused by directly running npx and uvx. *If deployed on an overseas server, it can also help solve network issues.*\n\nHowever, it is currently still possible to read the `/config/config.json` configuration file of MCP Proxy, but the risk is manageable. I have also raised a feature request with the developer to configure the config file with 400 permissions and run the npx and uvx commands as the nobody user. If this can be implemented, it will perfectly solve the arbitrary file reading issue.\n\n## Running MCP Proxy\n\n[![MCP Proxy](https://github.html.zone/TBXark/mcp-proxy)](https://github.com/TBXark/mcp-proxy)\n\nIf you have your own VPS with Docker deployed, you can use the following command to run MCP Proxy.\n\n```\ndocker run -d -p 9090:9090 -v /path/to/config.json:/config/config.json ghcr.io/tbxark/mcp-proxy:latest\n```\n\nIf you don't have your own VPS, you can use the free container service provided by [**claw.cloud**](https://404.li/claw) ($5 credit per month, GitHub registration must be older than 180 days).\n\nSince Claw has container size limitations, we need to use the following environment variables to configure the cache directories for npx and uvx to prevent container crashes.\n\n```\nUV_CACHE_DIR=/cache/uv\nnpm_config_cache=/cache/npm\n```\n\nSimultaneously mount 10GB of storage under the `/cache` path. Refer to my configuration: 0.5c CPU, 512M Memory, 10G Disk.\n\nThe final configuration is as follows:\n\n![Claw](https://static.miantiao.me/share/g4KUgP/claw.jpg)\n\n## Configuring MCP Proxy\n\nThe configuration file needs to be mounted at the `/config/config.json` path.
